You awaken to find yourself in a barren moor (must be South Yorkshire)
Try 'Look'


Grey foggy clouds float oppressively overhead,
reflected in the murky grey water which reaches up to your shins.
Some black plants barely poke out of the shallow water.


You notice a small watch-like device in your left hand,
YUP! you guessed it, you have a COMPASS!


Try 'North', 'East', 'South', or 'West': 


You head North.
You head East.
You head South.
You head West.


You travel 1 mile and find nothing of value.
You travel 2 miles and find nothing of value, you feel mildly tired.
You travel 3 miles and find more waste land, you feel moderately tired.
You travel 4 miles, you begin to feel really tired with nothing to show.
You travel 5 miles, you're really nuts you know that?
